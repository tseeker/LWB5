This file lists stuff that could be done to improve the current LWB5 source
code. It's mostly stuff that I had the intention of doing at some point but
didn't have the time to work on or finish. Of course, this is just a list of
ideas - feel free to ignore it altogether.


Back-end clean up:

* A lot of the game and site functions use older APIs that are deprecated.
** Calls to gameAction()
** Calls to logText()
** There's more, but I can't remember...

* Some of the improvements to the core library found in the forums branch
patch should be included - most importantly the SQL query stuff. Of course
this also implies modifying a lot of the code that actually uses SQL queries.

* While some of it has been removed, there is still a lot of SQL in the
various web handlers; it should be moved to the library.

* Internal messages are sent by inserting into the database directly in many
of the game's functions; this should be changed as there is an API for that.


Front-end clean up:

* When LWB5 was first written, I hadn't planned on using that much JavaScript.
In addition, JS libraries were not as common then as they are now. Therefore
most of the JS code is a terrible, ugly heap of spaghetti code and copy pasta.
It should be rewritten.


Improvements and missing features:

* Finishing the forums rewrite (started in the forums branch patch).

* Rewrite fleet handling - the database structure is brain dead, normalisation
is clearly required, and it'd reduce the various checks performed wherever
fleets are accessed.

* Fleet trajectory is buggy, it contains a relatively easily exploitable bug.
Needs redesign.

* Probes never made it into the final version.

* The IRC bot's source code should be upgraded to the latest version of
PHP-IRC.
