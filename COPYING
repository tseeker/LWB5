Licensing information
----------------------

The IRC bot code is based on PHP-IRC (http://www.phpbots.org/) with some
changes for LW integration. It is distributed under the GNU GPL license.

The main LW code (admin and scripts directories), as well as the CSS and JS
code (with the exception of the jquery library) in site/static, the planet
generator and the SQL database structure and associated functions are
distributed under the GNU GPL license. Same goes for whatever is in the
misc/ directory.

The outdated copy of the JQuery (http://www.jquery.org) library found in the
site/static/main/js/ directory is distributed under the MIT license.

Icons used in the site's appearance have been taken and modified from various
sources. Their respective licenses are mostly unknown.

The game data (including the manual and all files in the sql subdirectory
which contain actual values - sql/beta5/data/ most notably) remain the
exclusive property of Deep Clone Development. This data may be copied,
distributed or used as long as:
1) the distribution is free,
2) the distribution is complete and unmodified (it should match the
contents of the official SVN repository),
3) no profits are made from using this data.
Feel free to replace this data with something else entirely to get rid of
these licensing terms.


A copy of the GPLv2 is included in COPYING.GPL ; the MIT license may be found
in COPYING.MIT.
